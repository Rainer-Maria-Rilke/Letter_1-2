Viareggio, near Pisa (Italy)
April 5, 1903
You must pardon me, dear Sir, for waiting until today to gratefully remember
your letter of February 24: I have been unwell all this time, not really sick,
but oppressed by an influenza-like debility, which has made me incapable of
doing anything. And finally, since it just didn’t want to improve, I came to this
southern sea, whose beneficence helped me once before. But I am still not well,
writing is difficult, and so you must accept these few lines instead of your letter I
would have liked to send.
Of course, you must know that every letter of yours will always give me
pleasure, and you must be indulgent with the answer, which will perhaps often
leave you empty-handed; for ultimately, and precisely in the deepest and most
important matters, we are unspeakably alone; and many things must happen,
many things must go right, a whole constellation of events must be fulfilled, for
one human being to successfully advise or help another.
Today I would like to tell you just two more things: Irony: Don’t let yourself
be controlled by it, especially during uncreative moments. When you are fully
creative, try to use it, as one more way to take hold of life. Used purely, it too is
pure, and one needn’t be ashamed of it; but if you feel yourself becoming too
familiar with it, if you are afraid of this growing familiarity, then turn to great
and serious objects, in front of which it becomes small and helpless. Search into
the depths of Things: there, irony never descends — and when you arrive at the
edge of greatness, find out whether this way of perceiving the world arises from a
necessity of your being. For under the influence of serious Things it will either
fall away from you (if it is something accidental), or else (if it is really innate and
belongs to you) it will grow strong, and become a serious tool and take its place
among the instruments which you can form your art with.
And the second thing I want to tell you today is this:
Of all my books, I find only a few indispensable, and two of them are always
with me, wherever I am. They are here, by my side: the Bible, and the books of
the great Danish poet Jens Peter Jacobsen. Do you know his works? It is easy to
find them, since some have been published in Reclam’s Universal Library, in a
very good translation. Get the little volume of Six Stories by J. P. Jacobsen and his
novel Niels Lyhne, and begin with the first story in the former, which is called
“Mogens.” A whole world will envelop you, the happiness, the abundance, the
inconceivable vastness of a world. Live for a while in these books, learn from
them what you feel is worth learning, but most of all love them. This love will be
returned to you thousands upon thousands of times, whatever your life may
become — it will, I am sure go through the while fabric of your becoming, as one
of the most important threads among all the threads of your experiences, disappointments,
and joys.
If I were to say who has given me the greatest experience of the essence of
creativity, its depths and eternity, there are just two names I would mention:
Jacobsen, that great, great poet, and Auguste Rodin, the sculptor, who is without
peer among all artists who are alive today. —
And all success upon your path!
Yours,
Rainer Marie Rilke
